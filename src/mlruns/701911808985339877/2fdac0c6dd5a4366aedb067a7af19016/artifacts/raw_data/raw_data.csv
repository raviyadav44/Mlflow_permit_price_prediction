Kintsugi is an ancient art form that celebrates the Japanese philosophy of the beauty of imperfection. It involves putting broken pieces of pottery back together with gold and embracing the cracks to produce a beautiful piece of art.

In this kintsugi class, your experienced tutor will tell you all about the history and philosophy of kintsugi whilst taking you through the process of making your own kintsugi piece.

Kintsugi is a perfect solution for a mistakenly broken treasured item, but to practice this art form you'll learn how to safely break pottery to practice mending it in the kintsugi way, without overdoing the cracks. You'll use a hammer 
 with plenty of support from your teacher.

The gold of kintsugi is what makes it so beautiful and in the next stage of your craft class, you'll learn to use a micro metal mix with epoxy resin to create your gold solution. You'll then use this solution to fix together your broken pottery pieces, creating a wonderful piece of perfectly imperfect art. 

You'll finish this London kintsugi class with lots of new knowledge on kintsugi pottery and the ability to mend broken ceramic pieces. You'll also take away your own handmade piece of kintsugi art. Kintsugi is a therapeutic process and you'll feel a sense of calm and accomplishment as you finish this special workshop.

Your finished piece is only for display not for food use, microwaves, ovens or the dishwasher.",no,no,entertainment,local,onsite,amusement,,no,"Thanh Long le

The UOWD x Media Team Film Festival returns for its third edition, building on the success of the previous two events organized by the University of Wollongong in Dubai (UOWD) and the Media Department.. This festival is designed to showcase and celebrate the creative talents of students both within Dubai and internationally, through the production of short films and advertising shorts.
In today‚Äôs digital landscape, telling stories through screens has become easier than ever, with platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and the accessibility of smartphones. However, the journey from casual content creator to filmmaker, director, producer, editor, or scriptwriter requires a deeper mastery of the craft. The festival provides students with the opportunity to make this leap, challenging them to work collaboratively in teams to produce professional-quality content that reflects their creativity and storytelling skills.",no,no,business,local,onsite,,exhibition,no,"Michael Livingston Mallory, 0581683323",other,10/25/25 18:00,10/25/25 21:00,UOWD Campus,,Dubai,yes,,yes,yes,no,no,no,,,,,,5/5/25 8:41,5/5/25 8:41,no,,,,,,0.0,,,,"Daria Koroleva, 0558460698",,5/5/25 12:44,5/5/25 12:44,,
